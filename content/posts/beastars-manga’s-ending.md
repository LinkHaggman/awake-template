The BEASTARS manga’s ending is “in sight,” according to original manga creator Paru Itagaki. The writer/artist says she is putting everything she has into the work until the end and hopes fans will follow the journey.

Published in Weekly Shonen Champion since September 2016, Paru made these comments in the author’s notes section of an issue from January 2020. In early August 2020, the magazine announced that the series’ climax was coming up soon.

On September 23, 2020, Weekly Shonen Champion magazine released BEASTARS Chapters 194 and then announced that the final chapter was only three chapters away.

The final chapter, BEASTARS Chapter 196, will release in Japan on October 14, 2020. Volume 20 released on August 6, 2020, and Volume 21 is scheduled for October 8, 2020. VIZ Media released the official English translation of manga Volume 7 on July 21, 2020. Volume 8 was scheduled for September 15, 2020, and Volume 9 on November 17, 2020.



## BEASTARS Volume 22 to contain the manga’s ending

This is not the first time that Paru has mentioned ending the BEASTARS manga. Back in September 2019, she was directly asked how many volumes she was targeting for the manga series, and Paru responded by saying that she “would like the work to have at most twenty volumes.”

Manga creators for infamous for guessing wrong about how they will end a series and in this case the manga has already gone way past Volume 20. However, the BEASTARS manga’s ending is definitely happening in October 2020.

Since each manga volume typically has nine chapters, and Volume 21 should end with Chapter 187, that means BEASTARS Volume 22 will contain the final chapter.

The BEASTARS Volume 22 release date in Japan is scheduled for January 8, 2021
