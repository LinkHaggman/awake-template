VR event [Furality is now, by attendee count, the biggest furry convention](https://twitter.com/ScarTheFurry/status/1539325982116663297).

It has 15,079 attendees – 4000 more attendees than Midwest FurFest’s 2019 record of 11,019.

Chairman Daltyn however calls on furries to [not look at attendee counts “as a competition”](https://twitter.com/DaltynWolf/status/1540490749317447680?s=20&t=l6pfCZbGEAjHh6KWLKUhXg). Look at it instead as one more achievement furries earned, they added.
